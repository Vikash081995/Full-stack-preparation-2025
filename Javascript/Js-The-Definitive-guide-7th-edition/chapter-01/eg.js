// JavaScript's most important datatype is the object.

// An object is a collection of name/value pairs, or a string to value map.

let book = {
  // Objects are enclosed in curly braces.
  topic: "JavaScript", // The property "topic" has value "JavaScript."
  edition: 7, // The property "edition" has value 7
}; // The curly brace marks the end of the object.

// Access the properties of an object with . or []:
book.topic; // => "JavaScript"
book["edition"]; // => 7: another way to access property values.

book.author = "Flanagan"; // Create new properties by assignment.
book.contents = {}; // {} is an empty object with no properties.

// Conditionally access properties with ?. (ES2020):
book.contents?.ch01?.sect1; // => undefined: book.contents has no ch01 property.

// JavaScript also supports arrays (numerically indexed lists) of values:
let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]; // An array of 4 values, delimited with [ and ].

primes[0]; // => 2: the first element (index 0) of the array.
primes.length; // => 4: how many elements in the array.
primes[primes.length - 1]; // => 7: the last element of the array.

primes[4] = 9; // Add a new element by assignment.
primes[4] = 11; // Or alter an existing element by assignment.

let empty = []; // [] is an empty array with no elements.
empty.length; // => 0

// Arrays and objects can hold other arrays and objects:
let points = [
  // An array with 2 elements.
  { x: 0, y: 0 }, // Each element is an object.
  { x: 1, y: 1 },
];

let data = {
  // An object with 2 properties
  trial1: [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
  ], // The value of each property is an array.
  trial2: [
    [2, 3],
    [4, 5],
  ], // The elements of the arrays are arrays.
};
